# 3DPositionalTracking

Program to calibrate camera and track cartesian distances to markers, with camera as the origin. Greatest accuracy achieved was within 1mm. The intended purpose was for use as a tracking module in an arthroscopic surgical training station.

To-Do: Implement code in Python to test speed differences. Implement particle tracking to combat marker occlusion. Add in code for dual camera setup to further combat occlusion.   

Great thanks to George Lecakes for amazing series on marker tracking with OpenCV. Can be found here for those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfymgQwB_vE
